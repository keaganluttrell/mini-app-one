## Create A plan for the mini app
- front-end
  - React
- back-end
  - Express
- database
  - MongoDB or MySQL ?

## Mini-App Theme
 - Research Api's
 - Trefle api
 - search and save plant information

 First phase -> hard code
 - set up a search bar
  * search bar to make queries to the api -> log clicks to browser console first
 - set up a list view
  * list to display queries
 - set up an item view
  * item to display picture and name of item as a div

 Second Phase -> add styling to containers
 - create the skeleton for UI

 Third Phase -> add dynamic info
 - list view will be dynamic -> search or saved
 - item view will be clickable and display info on click
 - add items to saved

 Fourth Phase -> add persistent storage - create and read capability
 - saved items tab to manage list view
  * store all saved items in database
  * Create, Read, Updata, Delete Complete

 Fifth Phase -> add styling to item views
 - make styling for each dynamic item
 - save final touches for later

 Sixth Phase -> add api functionality by query
 - Get request for Api functionality
 - Item Title Click functionality
 - item cursor on hover img and title

 Final Phase -> One component at a time -> perhaps refactor and make more smaller components

fix scroll in mainListItem- shouldn't have the title scroll

Add cast, and a view for when someone clicks an actor to search for similar movies
with that actor. Visualize the component necessary to run that

Make stars into their own component if possible
Add because you liked columns
Find out what to do with the drop down bar -> Think about that

Make this a capstone work in progress
